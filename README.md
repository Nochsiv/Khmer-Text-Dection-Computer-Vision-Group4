# Khmer Text Detection - Computer Vision (Group 4)

## Project Overview
The **Khmer Text Detection** project aims to develop a cutting-edge system for detecting and recognizing **Khmer script** in real-world images. This project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to address the unique challenges of Khmer script recognition, contributing to digital innovation and accessibility in Cambodia.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Text Detection**: Identifies Khmer text in diverse image contexts, including documents, signs, and posters.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Employs state-of-the-art machine learning models for reliable recognition.
- **Localized Focus**: Custom-built for Khmer script, accounting for its unique structure, fonts, and diacritics.
- **Real-World Applications**: Designed for practical use in education, accessibility, and smart systems.

## Dataset
The dataset forms the backbone of this project and includes:
- **Diverse Sources**: Images from street signs, posters, handwritten notes, books, and official documents.
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Captures text in various lighting conditions, orientations, and backgrounds.
- **Annotated Data**: Fully labeled dataset for supervised learning, compatible with common ML frameworks.

## Technologies and Tools
The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `OpenCV`: For image processing and manipulation.
  - `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow`: For building and training models.
  - `pandas`: For dataset management and analysis.
- **Framework**: YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once) for text detection and recognition.

## System Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather images containing Khmer text from authentic Cambodian sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Annotate, augment, and prepare data for training.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a YOLO-based model optimized for Khmer text detection.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Validate model performance using test datasets.
5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model into an application for real-world use.
